## 💡 Project Overview

**NoiseScope** is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a crowdsourced system designed to collect, visualize, and analyze real-time ambient noise data. The goal is to create detailed, up-to-date noise maps of urban areas, helping city planners, researchers, and citizens understand and address noise pollution.

This repository contains the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) for the initial access portal, which directs users to either the **Admin Dashboard** or the **User/Contributor Portal**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dual Access Portal:** Secure entry points for both Administrators and Contributors.
* **Contributor Portal:** Allows users to submit noise level (dB) and location data via their mobile devices.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Provides tools for data review, noise map visualization, and user management (future development).
* **Simple, Responsive Design:** Ensures accessibility on various devices.
